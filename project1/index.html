    <h2>Intended Major</h2>
    <p>I plan to pursue a career in bioinformatics, an interdisciplinary field that combines both biology and computer science, my favorite subjects. </p>
    <p>Far too often, illnesses and diseases like cancer claim the innocent lives of those who dare to dream. I want to use my knowledge in both computer science and biology to create advancements toward AI and healthcare systems that can immediately identify diagnoses, treatments, and even surgical operations. Although AI has a long way until it can rid of its errors, I vow to be its bridge to healthcare, creating a healthy (but not a dependent) exchange between AI and humanity.</p>

    <h2>Personal Statement Topic</h2>
    <p>For my personal statement, I wrote about my love for musicals and how my desire to be in the spotlight pushed me out of my comfort zone. I crafted an extended metaphor that likens Aaron Burr's journey in the musical <em>Hamilton</em> to my own. My journey mirrors the show's core theme: the relentless pursuit of leaving your mark and 'not throwing away your shot.' For years, I was Aaron Burr—'waiting for it,' observing from the wings, my ideas and voice perpetually interrupted by my own social anxiety. But I longed to be Hamilton, to step into the spotlight and fight for my place. My work as a tutor and a TA was my 'room where it happens'—the moment I stopped waiting and started building my own stage. I transformed my role as a spectator in the audience into one as a principle cast member who helps others learn their lines and find their spotlight.</p>
    <h3>Hook/Introduction of Personal Statement</h3>
    <p>I was a Burr my entire life. Not Washington, not Jefferson, nor Adams. I was the forgotten founding father of America who always hesitated. But behind the curtains, I longed to be Hamilton, the star of the show who wastes no time fighting for his ideals. Although I dreamed of becoming the protagonist of my story, I never dared to step onto the stage until I stumbled upon an illegal 2-hour-22-minute-long musical.</p>
